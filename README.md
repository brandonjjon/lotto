# Lotto

Inspired by the recent Powerball lottery reaching a record high jackpot, I created my first Ruby library. It currently has support for Powerball, but the library has been set up to be easily extended with other lottery modules.

Fork & contribute!

### Installation & Usage
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/brandonjjon/lotto.git .
$ bin/lotto powerball
```
